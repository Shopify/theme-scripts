Theme Scripts is a collection of handy utility libraries which assist theme developers with problems unique to Shopify Themes development environment.

Theme scripts are uncoupled from a particular UI. Typically, they are used alongside a customized solution for a particular theme. For example, `@shopify/theme-cart` is a great way to interact with the Shopify Cart API and add and remove items, but it does not enforce a particular pattern to display or update the visual state of the cart.
